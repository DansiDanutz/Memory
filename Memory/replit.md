# MemoApp - Your Personal Memory Guardian

## Overview

MemoApp is a production-ready WhatsApp memory application that serves as your personal AI-powered memory assistant. Built with FastAPI and enterprise features, it provides secure voice-authenticated memory storage and retrieval through WhatsApp.

**Key Features:**
- üîê Voice-authenticated memory access with 10-minute session management
- üìä 5-tier security classification (general, chronological, confidential, secret, ultra_secret)
- üè¢ Multi-tenant support with department-based organization
- üë• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with 5 roles
- üìù Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- üîí Fernet encryption for sensitive memories
- üí¨ 14 WhatsApp commands for complete memory management
- üìà Prometheus metrics for monitoring

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
The application uses a TypeScript monorepo architecture organized into specialized packages and applications:

**Core Governance Packages:**
- `packages/sle` - Smart Limits Engine: Core orchestration layer that coordinates all other components
- `packages/mpl` - Memory Policy Layer: Implements disclosure tree policies with domain-based inheritance
- `packages/blts` - Bayesian Learning Trust System: Beta distribution-based trust scoring per member and domain
- `packages/cemg` - Conversational Epistemics & Mutual Knowledge Graph: Tracks who knows what information
- `packages/kpe` - Knowledge Provenance Engine: Verifies information sources with "Truth-of-Faith" mode
- `packages/ipsg` - Influence Planning & Strategy Generation: Risk assessment and response planning

**Additional Components:**
- `packages/conversation` - MCP-style conversation protocol with OpenAI integration
- `apps/dev-runner` - Demo application for testing SLE evaluations and conversation flows

### Smart Limits Engine (SLE) Decision Flow
The SLE implements a five-stage evaluation pipeline:

1. **MPL (Policy) Check**: Evaluates disclosure policies by domain, with security label enforcement
2. **CEMG (Mutual Knowledge)**: Estimates what the caller likely already knows
3. **BLTS (Trust Scoring)**: Calculates trust score using Bayesian learning with recency decay
4. **KPE (Provenance)**: Verifies information sources and timestamps in strict-truth mode
5. **IPSG (Risk Assessment)**: Analyzes potential risks and generates response strategies

**Decision Outcomes**: disclose, partial, redact, probe, verify, divert, decline, throttle, inconclusive

### Security Architecture
The system implements a compartmentalized security model with five security labels:
- General: Basic information sharing
- Secret: Elevated protection requiring verification
- Ultra: Highest protection, restricted to self-access only
- C2: User+1 person clearance
- C3: User+2 person clearance

### Data Model
Key entities include Person profiles with trust scores, Events with transcripts and provenance, Memory Data Cards (MDCs) with compartmentalized storage, and a Belief/Knowledge Graph tracking mutual awareness.
