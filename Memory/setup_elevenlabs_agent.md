### Step 4: Configure Tools/Functions

Add these custom functions for Memory Bot integration:

```javascript
// Store New Memory
{
  "name": "store_memory",
  "description": "Store a new memory in the user's memory bank",
  "parameters": {
    "content": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "tags": "array",
    "importance": "number"
  }
}

// Retrieve Memory
{
  "name": "search_memory",
  "description": "Search and retrieve specific memories",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "date_range": "object"
  }
}

// Set Reminder
{
  "name": "set_reminder",
  "description": "Set a reminder for future",
  "parameters": {
    "reminder": "string",
    "datetime": "string",
    "recurring": "boolean"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Integration with Memory Bot

#### **API Endpoint:**
```python
# In your FastAPI app
@app.post("/agent/webhook")
async def agent_webhook(data: Dict):
    """Handle ElevenLabs agent callbacks"""

    if data["type"] == "store_memory":
        # Store in your database
        memory = {
            "content": data["content"],
            "category": data["category"],
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "source": "elevenlabs_agent"
        }
        save_to_database(memory)

    elif data["type"] == "search_memory":
        # Search your database
        results = search_memories(data["query"])
        return {"memories": results}

    return {"status": "processed"}
```

#### **Connect to WhatsApp:**
```python
# When user sends WhatsApp message
async def handle_whatsapp_message(message):
    # Forward to ElevenLabs Agent
    response = await elevenlabs_agent.send_message(
        user_id=message.sender,
        text=message.text,
        context=get_user_memories(message.sender)
    )

    # Send agent response back via WhatsApp
    await send_whatsapp_reply(message.sender, response.text, response.audio)
```

### Step 6: Test Your Agent

1. Click "Test Agent" in the ElevenLabs dashboard
2. Try these example conversations:

**Example 1 - Store Memory:**
> You: "Remember that my project deadline is next Friday at 3 PM"
> Agent: "I've stored that for you. Your project deadline is Friday, [date] at 3 PM. Would you like me to remind you a day before?"

**Example 2 - Recall Memory:**
> You: "What did I tell you about my mom's birthday?"
> Agent: "You mentioned your mom's birthday is on January 25th, and she loves roses. It's coming up in [X] days. Would you like help planning something special?"

**Example 3 - Connect Information:**
> You: "I'm feeling stressed about work"
> Agent: "I understand. You have that project deadline next Friday. You've also mentioned before that taking walks helps you relax. Would you like me to help you break down the project tasks or suggest a good time for a walk?"

### Step 7: Deploy to Production

#### **Get Your Agent ID:**
```bash
# From ElevenLabs dashboard
Agent ID: agt_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Public URL: https://convai.elevenlabs.io/agt_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### **Embed in Your App:**
```html
<!-- Web Widget -->
<iframe
  src="https://convai.elevenlabs.io/embed/agt_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  width="400"
  height="600">
</iframe>
```

#### **Or Use the API:**
```python
# Direct API usage
agent_url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation"
headers = {"xi-api-key": "sk_7052aea282a47c77461bda1a518f35e7c9048abe8e5b0444"}

# Start conversation
response = requests.post(
    agent_url,
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "agent_id": "agt_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "message": "Hello, what do I have scheduled today?"
    }
