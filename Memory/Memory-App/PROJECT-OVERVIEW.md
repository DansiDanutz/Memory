# Memory App - Professional Project Overview

## Executive Summary

**Memory App** is a revolutionary privacy-first AI memory system that represents the next generation of personal AI assistants. Unlike traditional AI systems that treat privacy as an afterthought, Memory App puts privacy governance at its core through our proprietary **Smart Limits Engine (SLE)** - a sophisticated decision-making system that governs what information to share, with whom, and under what circumstances.

The system combines cutting-edge AI capabilities with enterprise-grade security, offering voice-activated memory access, advanced image understanding, and mobile integration - all while maintaining strict privacy boundaries and user control.
