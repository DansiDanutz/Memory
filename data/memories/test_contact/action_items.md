Good morning everyone, let's start our standup. I completed the API integration yesterday.
Great work John! I'm currently working on the frontend dashboard, should be done by tomorrow.
I need to discuss a blocker with Sarah about the API endpoints. Can we sync after this meeting?
Sure, I'll also need to deploy the new version to staging by Friday. Sarah, can you review the PR #123?
Will do! I'll review it today. Also, we have the client demo next Tuesday at 2 PM.

Good morning everyone, let's start our standup. I completed the API integration yesterday.
Great work John! I'm currently working on the frontend dashboard, should be done by tomorrow.
I need to discuss a blocker with Sarah about the API endpoints. Can we sync after this meeting?
Sure, I'll also need to deploy the new version to staging by Friday. Sarah, can you review the PR #123?
Will do! I'll review it today. Also, we have the client demo next Tuesday at 2 PM.
